### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm BPower0036. I develop things, because I want them better then other people have done it.

## Developer for Fun
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: [EasyDutch](https://github.com/BPower0036/EasyDutch/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I come along.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with solving a problem on my [YT-Nonstop extension](https://github.com/BPower0036/YT-Nonstop/issues/8)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything I maybe can know.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Make an issue on my GitHub pages
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Mr.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Everything done on GitHub I learned myself without any prior knowledge
