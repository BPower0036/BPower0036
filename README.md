### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm BPower0036. I develop things, because I want them better then other people have done it. <br>
I live in the [Netherlands/Holland](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2323309#map=5/51.154/9.712). If you want, you can talk English, Dutch and even German to me. I understand it all.

## Developer for Fun
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: [EasyDutch](https://github.com/EasyDutch-uBO/EasyDutch/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I come along and want to to different or nicer.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with solving a problem on my [YT-Nonstop extension](https://github.com/BPower0036/YT-Nonstop/issues/8)
